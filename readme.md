## Challenge Activity 1: Population projection

### Analysis:

The Population Projection tool is designed to predict Australia's population for the next five years using four main factors: birth rate, death rate, immigration rate and the current population. Users have the flexibility to input custom values for these elements, allowing the tool to offer a range of population predictions tailored to specific scenarios. This adaptability enhances its utility, whether it's researchers are examining demographic trends or policymakers planning for the future. This Python tool provides valuable insights making it an essential resource for diverse users.

### Algorithm design:

The central algorithm revolves around computing the annual growth based on user inputs: birth rate, death rate and immigration rate. To encapsulate the logic:

Annual Growth = (birth rate / SECONDS_IN_YEAR) - (death rate / SECONDS_IN_YEAR) + (immigration rate / SECONDS_IN_YEAR)

The formula takes the yearly averages of births, deaths and immigrants and gives us a net annual growth rate.
